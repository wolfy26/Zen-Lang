# Zen Lang
The first release of Zen Lang (then without a name). This version, when created, had no version number, documentation, or language name. 

Only the files `compiler.py` and `interpreter.py` remain of this version. Additional files `lexer.py`, which tokenized the input, and `run.py`, which executed everything, were used. Their early versions are not saved.

Version 0.0 supports variable definition, simple function creation, and elementary mathematical expressions. Only number and string literals are supported.
